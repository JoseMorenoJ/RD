# Introduction

## Udemy Course

A course about OO programming design with UML and C++. The course wasn't finished in Udemy though.

## Reckless Driver

This is about driving and crashing to things without breaking your car.
The game is fun.

## Contents

The game main part is designed but only as a win32/terminal application. It doesn't get any input from the player. It generates random objects in the road and random colissions with them. It stops when the health of the car is below zero.

# The running-version branch

This is about making a working version after the course finished. Before we add the HUB changes.
It is branched from the HUB_mods branch after we merged it to master. So it should be as if we have done the branch from master.

# The edit_README branch

We will use this branch to quick editing and formating to the README.md file and to everything that is related with the appearence of the GitHub repository.
